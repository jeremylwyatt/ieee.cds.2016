@phdthesis{mason_manipulator_1982,
	Abstract = {The primary goal of this research is to develop theoretical tools for analysis, synthesis, and application of primitive manipulator operations. The primary method is to extend an apply traditional tools of classical mechanics. The results are of such a general nature that they address many different aspects of industrial robotics, including effector and sensor design, planning and programming tools, and design of auxiliary equipment. Some of the manipulator operations studied are: Grasping an object: The object will usually slide and rotate during the period between first contact and prehension; Placing an object: The object may slip slightly in the fingers upon contact with the table as the base aligns with the table; and Pushing: Often the final stage of mating two parts involves pushing one object into the other. In each of these operations the motion of the object is determined partly by the manipulator and partly by frictional forces. Hence the theoretical analysis focuses on the problem of partially constrained motion with friction.},

@article{Howard2000,
	Abstract = {The majority of manipulation systems are designed with the assumption
	that the objects being handled are rigid and do not deform when grasped.
	This paper addresses the problem of robotic grasping and manipulation
	of 3-D deformable objects, such as rubber balls or bags filled with
	sand. Specifically, we have developed a generalized learning algorithm
	for handling of 3-D deformable objects in which prior knowledge of
	object attributes is not required and thus it can be applied to a
	large class of object types. Our methodology relies on the implementation
	of two main tasks. Our first task is to calculate deformation characteristics
	for a non-rigid object represented by a physically-based model. Using
	nonlinear partial differential equations, we model the particle motion
	of the deformable object in order to calculate the deformation characteristics.
	For our second task, we must calculate the minimum force required
	to successfully lift the deformable object. This minimum lifting
	force can be learned using a technique called `iterative lifting'.
	Once the deformation characteristics and the associated lifting force
	term are determined, they are used to train a neural network for
	extracting the minimum force required for subsequent deformable object
	manipulation tasks. Our developed algorithm is validated with two
	sets of experiments. The first experimental results are derived from
	the implementation of the algorithm in a simulated environment. The
	second set involves a physical implementation of the technique whose
	outcome is compared with the simulation results to test the real
	world validity of the developed methodology.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a survey of the research carried out to date in
	the area of computer-based deformable modelling. Due to their cross-disciplinary
	nature, deformable modelling techniques have been the subject of
	vigorous research over the past three decades and have found numerous
	applications in the fields of machine vision (image analysis, image
	segmentation, image matching, and motion tracking), visualisation
	(shape representation and data fitting), and computer graphics (shape
	modelling, simulation, and animation). Previous review papers have
	been field/application specific and have therefore been limited in
	their coverage of techniques. This survey focuses on general deformable
	models for computer-based modelling, which can be used for computer
	graphics, visualisation, and various image processing applications.
	The paper organizes the various approaches by technique and provides
	a description, critique, and overview of applications for each. Finally,
	the state of the art of deformable modelling is discussed, and areas
	of importance for future research are suggested.},

	Abstract = {Many simulation environments - particularly those intended for medical
	simulation - require solid objects to deforrn at interactive rates,
	with deformation properties that correspond to real materials. Furthermore,
	new objects may be created frequently (for example, each time a new

	the model preparation process. This paper provides a pipeline for
	rapid preparation of deformable objects with no manual intervention,
	specifically focusing on mesh generation (preparing solid meshes
	from surface models), automated calibration of models to finite element
	reference analyses (including a novel approach to reducing the complexity
	of calibrating nonhomogeneous objects), and automated skinning of

	Abstract = {Physically based deformable models have been widely embraced by the
	Computer Graphics community. Many problems outlined in a previous
	survey by Gibson and Mirtich have been addressed, thereby making
	these models interesting and useful for both offline and real-time
	applications, such as motion pictures and video games. In this paper,
	we present the most significant contributions of the past decade,
	which produce such impressive and perceivably realistic animations
	and simulations: finite element/difference/volume methods, mass-spring
	systems, mesh-free methods, coupled particle systems and reduced
	deformable models-based on modal analysis. For completeness, we also
	make a connection to the simulation of other continua, such as fluids,
	gases and melting objects. Since time integration is inherent to
	all simulated phenomena, the general notion of time discretization
	is treated separately, while specifics are left to the respective
	models. Finally, we discuss areas of application, such as elastoplastic
	deformation and fracture, cloth and hair animation, virtual surgery
	simulation, interactive entertainment and fluid/smoke animation,
	and also suggest areas for future research.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a versatile and robust model for geometrically
	complex deformable solids. Our approach can be applied to deformable
	tetrahedral meshes and to deformable triangle meshes. The model considers
	elastic and plastic deformation. It handles a large variety of material
	properties ranging from stiff to fluid-like behavior. Due to the
	computational efficiency of our approach, complex environments consisting
	of up to several thousand primitives can be simulated at interactive
	speed.
	
	The presented approach to deformable modeling is part of a simulation
	environment with integrated collision handling for tetrahedral meshes.
	For visualization purposes, tetrahedral meshes can be coupled with
	highresolution surface meshes. Results are presented for deformable
	tetrahedral meshes and for deformable triangle meshes which are used
	to represent cloth and discrete shells.},
