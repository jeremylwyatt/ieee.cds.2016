@phdthesis{mason_manipulator_1982,
	Abstract = {The primary goal of this research is to develop theoretical tools for analysis, synthesis, and application of primitive manipulator operations. The primary method is to extend an apply traditional tools of classical mechanics. The results are of such a general nature that they address many different aspects of industrial robotics, including effector and sensor design, planning and programming tools, and design of auxiliary equipment. Some of the manipulator operations studied are: Grasping an object: The object will usually slide and rotate during the period between first contact and prehension; Placing an object: The object may slip slightly in the fingers upon contact with the table as the base aligns with the table; and Pushing: Often the final stage of mating two parts involves pushing one object into the other. In each of these operations the motion of the object is determined partly by the manipulator and partly by frictional forces. Hence the theoretical analysis focuses on the problem of partially constrained motion with friction.},

@article{Howard2000,
	Abstract = {The majority of manipulation systems are designed with the assumption
	that the objects being handled are rigid and do not deform when grasped.
	This paper addresses the problem of robotic grasping and manipulation
	of 3-D deformable objects, such as rubber balls or bags filled with
	sand. Specifically, we have developed a generalized learning algorithm
	for handling of 3-D deformable objects in which prior knowledge of
	object attributes is not required and thus it can be applied to a
	large class of object types. Our methodology relies on the implementation
	of two main tasks. Our first task is to calculate deformation characteristics
	for a non-rigid object represented by a physically-based model. Using
	nonlinear partial differential equations, we model the particle motion
	of the deformable object in order to calculate the deformation characteristics.
	For our second task, we must calculate the minimum force required
	to successfully lift the deformable object. This minimum lifting
	force can be learned using a technique called `iterative lifting'.
	Once the deformation characteristics and the associated lifting force
	term are determined, they are used to train a neural network for
	extracting the minimum force required for subsequent deformable object
	manipulation tasks. Our developed algorithm is validated with two
	sets of experiments. The first experimental results are derived from
	the implementation of the algorithm in a simulated environment. The
	second set involves a physical implementation of the technique whose
	outcome is compared with the simulation results to test the real
	world validity of the developed methodology.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a survey of the research carried out to date in
	the area of computer-based deformable modelling. Due to their cross-disciplinary
	nature, deformable modelling techniques have been the subject of
	vigorous research over the past three decades and have found numerous
	applications in the fields of machine vision (image analysis, image
	segmentation, image matching, and motion tracking), visualisation
	(shape representation and data fitting), and computer graphics (shape
	modelling, simulation, and animation). Previous review papers have
	been field/application specific and have therefore been limited in
	their coverage of techniques. This survey focuses on general deformable
	models for computer-based modelling, which can be used for computer
	graphics, visualisation, and various image processing applications.
	The paper organizes the various approaches by technique and provides
	a description, critique, and overview of applications for each. Finally,
	the state of the art of deformable modelling is discussed, and areas
	of importance for future research are suggested.},

	make a connection to the simulation of other continua, such as fluids,

	all simulated phenomena, the general notion of time discretization
	is treated separately, while specifics are left to the respective

  abstract = {Robot control in uncertain and dynamic environments can be greatly improved using sensor-based control. Vision is a versatile low-cost sensory modality, but low sample rate, high sensor delay and uncertain measurements limit its usability, especially in strongly dynamic environments. Vision can be used to estimate a 6-DOF pose of an object by model-based pose-estimation methods, but the estimate is typically not accurate along all degrees of freedom. Force is a complementary sensory modality allowing accurate measurements of local object shape when a tooltip is in contact with the object. In multimodal sensor fusion, several sensors measuring different modalities are combined together to give a more accurate estimate of the environment. As force and vision are fundamentally different sensory modalities not sharing a common representation, combining the information from these sensors is not straightforward. We show that the fusion of tactile and visual measurements enables to estimate the pose of a moving target at high rate and accuracy. Making assumptions of the object shape and carefully modeling the uncertainties of the sensors, the measurements can be fused together in an extended Kalman filter. Experimental results show greatly improved pose estimates with the proposed sensor fusion. },

  abstract  = {In recent years, researchers have proposed introducing statistical
	shape knowledge into level set- based segmentation methods in order
	to cope with insufficient low- level information. While these priors
	were shown to drastically improve the segmentation of familiar objects,
	so far the focus has been on statistical shape priors which are static
	in time. Yet, in the context of tracking deformable objects, it is
	clear that certain silhouettes ( such as those of a walking person)
	may become more or less likely over time. In this paper, we tackle
	the challenge of learning dynamical statistical models for implicitly
	represented shapes. We show how these can be integrated as dynamical
	shape priors in a Bayesian framework for level set- based image sequence
	segmentation. We assess the effect of such shape priors " with memory"
	on the tracking of familiar deformable objects in the presence of
	noise and occlusion. We show comparisons between dynamical and static
	shape priors, between models of pure deformation and joint models
	of deformation and transformation, and we quantitatively evaluate
	the segmentation accuracy as a function of the noise level and of
	the camera frame rate. Our experiments demonstrate that level set-
	based segmentation and tracking can be strongly improved by exploiting
	the temporal correlations among consecutive silhouettes which characterize
	deforming shapes.},

	Measurements corresponding to the interaction force at the level

	of textured objects undergoing nonrigid deformations over a sequence

	of global and local deformations, The mesh is constructed using an
	adaptive triangulation procedure that places more triangles over
	high detail areas. Through robust least squares techniques and modal
	analysis, efficient estimation of global object deformations is achieved,
	based on a set of sparse displacement measurements. A local warping
	procedure is then applied to minimize the intensity matching error
	between subsequent images, and thus estimate local deformations,
	Among the major contributions of this paper are novel techniques
	developed to acquire knowledge of the object dynamics and structure
	directly from the image sequence, even in the absence of prior intelligence
	regarding the scene, Specifically, a coarse-to-fine estimation scheme
	is first developed, which adapts the model to locally deforming features.
	Subsequently, principal components modal analysis is used to accumulate
	knowledge of the object dynamics. This knowledge is finally exploited
	to constrain the object deformation. The problem of tracking the
	model over time is addressed, and a novel motion-compensated prediction
	approach is proposed to facilitate this. A novel method for the determination
	of the dynamical principal axes of deformation is developed, The
	experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of
	the proposed scheme, which has many potential applications in the
	areas of image coding, image analysis, and computer graphics.},
